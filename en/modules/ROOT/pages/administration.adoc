// Start writing here

This section describes all the tasks carried out by document administrators at different moments of the authoring workflow.

The first and most important task is the <<create-repository, creation and configuration>> of a GitHub repository to work on a document.
Documents follow one of two possible workflows:

1. They are directly created as Asciidoc documents.
In this case the creation of the repository is truly the first action to undertake.

2. The document is written in some other (collaborative) platform, and then <<conversion, converted to Asciidoc>>.
Here we can create the repository at any time before the conversion.

[WARNING]
--
The conversion to Asciidoc is a *one time, single direction* action.

Once a document has been converted and stored in its Git repository, trying to edit it with different procedures than described in Section xref:authoring.adoc[Document authoring] of this guide is strongly discouraged.

[#create-repository]
== Create the repository for a new document

Every document requires the creation of a new repository in Decidim's space at GitHub.

.Decidim's organization page on GitHub
****
[.text-center]
https://github.com/decidim
****

The document administrator needs to be a member of the Decidim organization at GitHub to be able to create new repositories for Decidim.
Ask to an https://github.com/orgs/decidim/people?query=+role%3Aowner[owner of the Decidim organization] if you are not already a member.

The steps to get the new repository are described in the following sections.

:!step:
=== (Step {counter:step:1}) Import the repository template for new documents

NOTE: _Importing_ a repository is a different concept from _forking_ or _creating_ an empty one.

Go to the btn:[＋ ▾] drop down menu on GitHub's top bar and select the menu:Import repository[] option, as shown in the following figure:

.GitHub import option
image::github-import-option-selection.png[Import repository option]

Decidim has a https://github.com/decidim/docs-new-document-template[repository with a template for new documents] called `docs-new-document-template`.
As shown in <<github-import-form-fig>> below:

. Input `https://github.com/decidim/docs-new-document-template.git` as the repository to clone (i.e. import from).
. Select `decidim` organization as the owner of the repository, if you have other options. If this option does not appear, you probably do not have the needed permissions (see the beginning of section <<create-repository>>).
. Choose a name for your new repository that begins with `docs-`, a convention we use to easily find documentation repositories.
. Press the btn:[Begin import] button.

The import can take some seconds or minutes.

[#github-import-form-fig]
.GitHub import form

In contrast with a GitHub fork, https://help.github.com/articles/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer/[a repository import] does not keep any link to the original repository (in this case, the template).

Our new repository template defines the basic file structure to facilitate:

* The <<publish, online publication of the document>>.
* The creation of multi-lingual documents (English, Spanish, Catalan).
* Filling up all the important metadata.

If you want to understand what is in the template, its contents are described in section xref:document-template.adoc#repo-anatomy[Anatomy of a document repository].

[#add-collaborators]
=== (Step {counter:step}) Add collaborators to the repository

Once the repository is created, you can visit its main page in GitHub.
If you called it, for example, `docs-my-great-content`, the URL should be `https://github.com/decidim/docs-my-great-content`.

By default only you (the creator and administrator) can write to the recently created repository.
To enable collective writing you must add collaborators going to menu:Settings[Collaborators & teams].

Add the team `docs` and any other individual or team collaborator that needs access to the repository.
Give them "Write" permission.

[#github-collaborators-fig]
.GitHub collaborators form
image::github-collaborators.png[, 800, align="center"]

=== (Step {counter:step}) Protect the `master` branch and add explicit permissions to it

Go to menu:Settings[Branches].
Under "Branch protection rules", choose branch `master`.

Select options "Protect this branch" and "Restrict who can push to this branch", and deselect all other options.
In section "People and teams with push access" add all the people and teams that you added in <<add-collaborators>>.
Push btn:[Save changes].

image::github-branch-protection.png[]

Protection of branch `master` gives us an extra guarantee that nobody will overwrite this branch by mistake.
All changes will be incremental and it will be possible to undo them if necessary.

=== (Step {counter:step}) Add a short description to the repository

At the top of the menu:Code[] panel you will see the following message: "_No description, website, or topics provided._"
Press the btn:[Edit] button on the right to change the description.
Try to use one single sentence, at most two.

[#github-description-fig]

image::github-edit-description-and-topics.png[]

=== (Step {counter:step}) Add topics (labels) to the repository

As shown in <<github-description-fig>>, there is also an https://help.github.com/articles/about-topics/["Add topics" option].
Press it.
Add at least the topics `decidim` and `decidim-docs`.

=== (Step {counter:step}) Configure other repository options

Go to menu:Settings[Options] and disable "Wikis" and "Projects".
Leave the other options in its default configuration.

.GitHub's repository options
image::github-repo-options.png[]

=== Additional steps

Once created and configured the public repository, the next steps the administrator can take (or task a capable writer with) are:

. xref:authoring.adoc#fill-up-metadata[Fill up the metadata for the document].

. xref:authoring.adoc#create-page[Create an Asciidoc file] for every web page we want to show in https://docs.decidim.org[] (we usually show every major section or chapter of a document as a separate web page).

. <<conversion, Convert the document to Asciidoc>>, if we already have a preliminary version in Google Drive or written in any other format.

. Set up the document for <<publish, publication at `docs.decidim.org`>>.

If you have just imported your first document template, you may want to read section xref:document-template.adoc#repo-anatomy[Anatomy of a document repository], to understand how files are organized in the repository.

[#conversion]
== Convert a document to Asciidoc

We use a command-line conversion tool called https://pandoc.org/[Pandoc].
See how to install it at xref:prerequisites.adoc#install-pandoc[Install Pandoc].

Pandoc can convert from Libre Office, Microsoft Office, HTML, and many other formats to Asciidoc.

Imagine you have a Microsoft Word (sic) document called `MyAwesomeDoc.docx`.
You can run (copy it as a single line command):

[source, shell]
--
pandoc --to=asciidoc --wrap=none --atx-headers  --extract-media=images --output=my-awesome-document.adoc MyAwesomeDoc.docx
--

A beautiful Asciidoc file called `my-awesome-document.adoc` will be created with the text of your document.
If the original document contains any image, an `images` directory will appear containing a file for each image.
Images will be correctly referenced in the Asciidoc file.

The above command is independent of input format, you only need to change your input and output file names (e.g. replace `MyAwesomeDoc.docx` to `MyAwesomeDoc.html`).
Option `--wrap=none` means that lines will not be cut at some fixed width (by default 72 characters) at it is typically done in source code.

Option `--atx-headers` means headers will be set as

[source, asciidoc]
--
= Introduction
--

and not

[source, asciidoc]
--
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
--

Some recommendations when you convert with Pandoc:

. Unfortunately, conversion from Microsoft Word or HTML seems to work better than from OpenDocument (`.odt`).
If your original document is in Google Drive, you can choose to store a local copy in either Word (menu:File[Download as, Microsoft Word (.docx)]) or HTML (menu:File[Download as, Web Page (.html, zipped)]).
. Which conversion path is best depends on the document.
For complex documents it may be worthwhile to try some possibilities before choosing.
. Do not convert full documents, first copy each section in a different file and then convert section by section.
. Do not copy the front page or the table of contents.
Those need to be re-created from Asciidoc.
. Remove section numbering before converting.
We want Asciidoc to number sections (and figures, tables, etc.) automatically.
This can be done in a single action if your original document uses header styles consistently.
It can also be done after the conversions, but it is usually more work.

After the conversion, you will need to adjust some things manually:

. When you move your files to the repository, images will be placed under the default image directory, `assets/images`, and all references to images in your `.adoc` files will need to be adapted accordingly (in essence, its path removed).
. Header identifiers (or any other element identifier) could have been created, and could be useful.
If you want to rename them, do it consistently.
If some of them are spurious, remove them.
. Cross references and footnotes may need manual intervention also.

Pandoc has many other options described in the http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html[Pandoc User's Guide].
