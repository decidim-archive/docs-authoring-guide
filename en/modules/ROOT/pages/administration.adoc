== Create the repository for a new document

This repository is meant to be https://help.github.com/articles/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer/[imported] (instead of cloned/forked) to create a new document for the Decidim project.

Once created and configured the public repository, the next steps the administrator can take (or task a capable writer with) are:

. xref:writing.adoc#metadata-filling[Fill up the metadata for the document].

. <<conversion,Convert the document to Asciidoc>>, if we already have a preliminary version in Google Drive or written in any other format.

. Set up the document for <<publication,publication at `docs.decidim.org`>>.

[#conversion]
== Convert a document to Asciidoc

[#publication]
== Publish at `docs.decidim.org`

=== Configure the navigation

== Generate a PDF file

== Merge changes from writers

// == Update the configuration
