// Start writing here

== The easy way: editing on-line

The only other sections you probably need to read are:

* <<asciidoc>>

* <<structure>>

== Power writers

[#asciidoc]
== Introduction to Asciidoc

=== Asciidoc guidelines

[#structure]
== Structure of the repository



[#metadata-filling]
== Fill up the metadata

== Create a new section or chapter

You can remove the line saying

[source, asciidoc]
----
// Start writing here
----

It is useful only to avoid writing just below the last include, without an empty line, which could cause problems.

=== Update the outline of the document

== When something goes wrong with Git
