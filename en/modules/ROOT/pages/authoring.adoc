// Start writing here

Our collaborative editing process is based on Git and GitHub.

We distinguish between:

* *Regular writers*, that <<regular-writers, modify files online>> with the editing interface provided by GitHub.
* *Power writers*, that can <<power-writers, work offline>> and take advantage of the better tooling available (e.g., better spell-checkers and Asciidoc renderers) for desktop editors.

Collaborators that are not part of to the Decidim team can write both online and offline, depending on their proficiency with offline tools.
See <<external-collaborators>> for more details.

[#regular-writers]
== Editing on-line on GitHub

The easiest way of editing any of the Decidim's documents is using GitHub's own integrated editor.
Once you are xref:prerequisites.adoc#create-github-account[logged into GitHub] you have two ways to arrive to the text you need to modify:

* If you are visiting our documentation site at https://docs.decidim.org, you can open the online editor on any contents by following the "Edit this page" link.
* You can navigate the source folder tree of any document in https://github.com/decidim?q=docs, select a file and press the edition button.

NOTE: TODO: Adapt https://github.com/WGBH/pbucore/wiki/Contributing-to-the-project-through-Github-web-interface.

The only other sections you probably need to read for this lightweight editing workflow are:

* <<asciidoc>>

* <<folder-structure>>

[#asciidoc]
== How to write Asciidoc

We use Asciidoc as our markup language.
There is a quite complete http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[Asciidoc tutorial].

You can easily get acquainted with Asciidoc and try its features using the online editor https://asciidoclive.com[AsciidocLIVE].

When you try to do more complex things you may need the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[Asciidoc User Manual], that contains a complete reference for the language.

=== Asciidoc guidelines

We try to adhere to http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/[good Asciidoc writing practices].

Some highlights, and some guidelines that are specific to our setup follow:

* For images, you simply need to write the filename (including extension), with no directory prefix:
+
[source, asciidoc, subs="quotes"]
----
image::__IMAGE_FILE_NAME__[]
----

* Use ATX headers, this is, as example:
+
[source, asciidoc]
--
= Introduction
--
+
instead of
+
[source, asciidoc]
--
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
+
Both are syntactically correct Asciidoc, but the former is more maintainable.

* Try to write one sentence per line:
+
--
. Try to place a manual line break after every sentence.
This will not be the case for text converted with Pandoc, but you can apply this rule for newly written text.
. Do not split long sentences with extra line breaks (neither manually nor automatically), leave your editor do the _visual_ line wrapping for you.
--
+
Text written in this manner is better suited to get put under version control and better visualized in a variety of editors.

[#folder-structure]
== Folder structure of a document

As explained in xref:overview.adoc#repos-and-vc[Repositories and version control], every document is stored in a _file repository_.
All our repositories are based upon a template that sets up the same structure.
You can navigate this structure both on GitHub or in your computer if you locally clone the GitHub repository.

The following figure shows the folder hierarchy and where each type of file is placed in a repository containing one of our documents:

[listing, subs="special characters, callouts, replacements, quotes"]
----

│   └── [...]

----
<1> Folder for the Catalan version.
It has the same structure as the English version.
<2> Folder for the English version.
<3> All files to be downloaded from the website (e.g. PDF files) belong to this folder.
<4> All images (in PNG, SVG or JPEG format) are stored here.
<5> All text for the document is placed in this folder, with an `.adoc` file for every chapter or section.
<6> This folder contains `.adoc` files that are meant to be displayed only as _includes_ of `.adoc` files in folder `pages`.
<7> Authorship criteria and how to contribute to this document.
You do not need to change this file.
<8> Metadata file: it defines a value for attributes like `\{title}`, `\{authors}`, `\{summary}`, etc. that can be reused all across the document source files.
<9> A file including all other `.adoc` files.
See <<add-ref-to-single-page>>.
<10> Folder for the Spanish version.
It has the same structure as the English version.

You can browse online a repository containing one of our documents, e.g. https://github.com/decidim/docs-features/tree/new-template, and check that this folder structure is fulfilled.

A more in-depth description of this folder structure is given in xref:administration#repo-anatomy[Anatomy of a repository].

[#power-writers]
== Power writing with Visual Studio Code

In this section we assume you have xref:prerequisites.adoc#install-vscode[installed Visual Studio Code].

=== Clone a repository to work offline

To edit with Visual Studio Code you need to clone a GitHub repository locally in your own computer:

. Go to the GitHub page of the document you want to work on, e.g., `https://github.com/decidim/docs-social-contract`.
. Press button btn:[Clone or download].
. Copy the repository URL for HTTPS.
. In Visual Studio Code, go to menu:View[Command Palette] and select command `Git: Clone`.
. Paste the URL of the repository and press kbd:[Enter].
. Select the destination folder.
A new folder with the name of the repository will be created inside the folder you select.

Now Visual Studio Code gives you the option of opening the new created folder, or adding it to the current workspace.
We suggest to cancel and reject both options, and then follow the advice given in <<vscode-spell-checker>>.

=== Configure GitHub credentials

NOTE: TODO.

[#vscode-spell-checker]
=== Use the spell checker

Assuming you have xref:prerequisites.adoc#spell-checker-extension[installed the Visual Studio Code spell checker] and some dictionaries, you can set up a language at folder level.

Our advice is to go to menu:File[Open Folder] and, instead of opening the root folder of a repository, open one of the language folders, i.e., either [.path]#ca#, or [.path]#en#, or [.path]#es# in our <<folder structure, standard template structure>>.
In this way you can easily configure the language of the folder and your set up will be stored by Visual Studio Code for next sessions:

. When editing some file in the folder, press the file name indicator in the down left corner of the editing window.
+
image::vscode-filename-indicator.png[]

. In the language selection panel, enable the "Folder" level.
In the "Folder" column, enable the language you are editing for (british English in the example image) and disable all other languages.
+
image::vscode-select-languages.png[]


[#fill-up-metadata]
== Fill up the metadata

For every document we need to define some basic information:

* Title
* Version
* Authors
* Summary
* Keywords
* [...]

Most of this values are defined in one single place (well, once per language, in fact), and then reused everywhere.
In this way we do not need to replace more than one string when one of this values is updated, and we keep things consistent.
The exception is the title of the document, that is defined twice, but let document administrators xref:administrators.adoc#document-config-file[handle this].

This is possible thanks to what it is called _attribute_ in Asciidoc terminology.
Inside an Asciidoc document we can define a series of attributes in this way:

[source, asciidoc]
----
:doctitle: Eleanor Rigby (Lyrics)
:authors: John Lennon, Paul McCartney
----

As you can see, every attribute is defined in a different line, with the name of the attribute between colons (`:`).

WARNING: The blank space between the name of the attribute and the value we assign to it is mandatory.

Then we can write `\{doctitle}` or `\{authors}` anywhere in the same `.adoc` file (or any `.adoc` file that includes the one assigning a value to those attributes) and these placeholders will be replaced to the assigned value ("Eleanor Rigby (Lyrics)" and "John Lennon, Paul McCartney" respectively).

The place where all the relevant metadata for a document is defined (for the English language) is:

.Metadata file path (English)
****
[.text-center]
`en/modules/ROOT/pages/_partials/README.adoc`
****

Open this file, either online or with your desktop editor, and you will see at the beginning of the file a list of attributes.
Every attribute is preceded by an explanation of what this attribute is used for, and if it is mandatory to assign it a value.
The list of attributes ends with a line with the following content:

[source, asciidoc]
----
// end::metadata[]
----

Lines beginning with `//` are not processed when generating HTML or other formats from Asciidoc.
Do not touch anything after this line.

The value of an attribute can be:

* A single word (or a number, or a date, etc.)
* A sentence
* A paragraph

[WARNING]
--
Do not write more than one paragraph as the value of an attribute.
// When editing attributes in the `README.adoc` file, *do not leave blank lines between attribute definitions*.
--

The `README.adoc` file is included in all the other `.adoc` files contained in the document.
This means that, once they are set up, you can use any of the attributes in any other file.
Some of the files already present in the repository use these attributes in different ways.
For instance, file `doc-info.adoc` formats all metadata in a table for display in both HTML and PDF format.

// [IMPORTANT]
// --
// Unfortunately, every time we change the file `en/modules/ROOT/pages/_partials/README.adoc`
// --

[#create-page]
== Create a new documentation page

Every content we want to see converted to a single web page in https://docs.decidim.org must be written to its own Asciidoc file.
For example, for large documents, at least every chapter or major section must have its own `.adoc` file.
If some section is very long, it can also be split up into smaller source files/web pages.

The smaller the contents, the easier is to reuse them by _including_ in another place.
But it is not necessary to make very small pages either, you still have the possibility to _link_ to any internal header from anywhere in the documentation site.

In order to add a new page to your document, follow the steps in the next sections.

:!step:
=== (Step {counter:step:1}) Add a new Asciidoc file to the repository

The file must be placed in `\{LANG}/modules/ROOT/pages`.

The file name should be based upon the title of the section it is going to contain, and must adhere to the following conventions:

* Use only *lower case* letters, numbers, and "-" (hyphen) symbol. Avoid any other character, including punctuation symbols.
* Avoid accents or any other character modifiers.
* Use "-" (hyphen) to separate words.
* The file name must be in *English*.
* Use extension: `.adoc`.
* Optionally reduce the length of the name if name clashes seem improbable.
Take into account that those names will be used also as URLs in the documentation site.

[#file-naming-example]
.Page/section file naming
====
If your section or chapter is named "Deliberative Democracy: How About That?" two possible names would be:

* `deliberative-democracy-how-about-that.adoc`
* `deliberative-democracy.adoc`
====

[IMPORTANT]
--
The same file name *must* be used in all languages if the document has translations.
So, folders `en/modules/ROOT/pages`, `ca/modules/ROOT/pages` and `es/modules/ROOT/pages` should all contain the same files, and all files should be named in English.
--

Copy the following text to the beginning of the file (the same text appears in file `introduction.adoc` from the template), replacing header "Introduction" to the true title of your new section:

[source, asciidoc]
----
= Introduction <1>
:experimental:
:icons: font
:page-partial:
:source-highlighter: highlightjs

\ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[] <2>
\endif::[]

include::{partialsdir}/README.adoc[tag=metadata] <3>

// Start writing here
----
<1> Header to replace.
The rest of the text can be copied verbatim.
<2> This include is only necessary to get a correct preview while editing.
<3> Including the `README.adoc` file, where attributes like `\{doctitle}`, `\{revnum}` (version), or `\{authors}` are defined, means that we can use any of these variables in our `.adoc` files.

// // You can remove the line saying:
//
// [source, asciidoc]
// ----
// // Start writing here
// ----
//
// It is useful only to avoid writing just below the last include, without an empty line, // which could cause problems.

[#add-ref-to-single-page]
=== (Step {counter:step:1}) Add a reference to the new file in `single-page.adoc`

The template puts a file `single-page.adoc` in `{LANG}/modules/ROOT/pages`.

Include the newly created `.adoc` file in `single-page.adoc`, following this example:

.Inclusion in `single-page.adoc`
====
If your file is named `deliberative-democracy.adoc`, add a line

[source, asciidoc]
----
\include::deliberative-democracy.adoc[]
----

To `single-page.adoc`.
====

In the file you will find highlighted 2 places where the inclusion is possible.
For regular sections or chapters, use the second slot, and place the new `include` in the correct order with respect the already existing sections.
Leave always a blank line between `include` directives.
The first and third slots are for preambles and appendixes, respectively.

At the beginning of the second slot you will find a directive

[source, asciidoc]
----
\include::introduction.adoc[]
----

given as example.
Replace it if your document does not contain a file named `introduction.adoc`.

File `single-page.adoc` has three purposes:

1. During writing, allows to get a rendered preview of the whole document. This only works for desktop, offline editors.
2. It is used to generate a _single page_ view of the document in HTML that can be linked from the documentation site.
3. It is also the base to generate a PDF file.

=== (Step {counter:step:1}) Add a reference to the new file in `nav.adoc`

File [.path]#\{LANG}/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc# can contain references to any files or sections in the documents.
Its items and sub-items are used to present a navigation menu for the document (you can think of it as a table of contents).

NOTE: TODO: navigation menu screenshot.

Add a reference to the new file:

.Reference from `nav.adoc`
====
If your file is named `deliberative-democracy.adoc`, add a line

[source, asciidoc]
----
* xref:deliberative-democracy.adoc[Deliberative democracy]
----

To `nav.adoc`.

The text between brackets is what will be shown in the navigation menu.

[#external-collaborators]
== External collaborators

People that does not take part in the core team that develops Decidim can use whatever editing tools they please, including those suggested in this guide for <<regular-writers, regular writers>> and <<power-writers, power writers>>.

The main difference with Decidim Team members is that they are not going to immediately get writing access to Decidim's repositories (maybe never).
They need to https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[fork] any repository they want to modify (this does not require any authorization), and interact with the document administrators through https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/[pull requests].

If you want to collaborate and have not used Git or GitHub before, you can write an email to hola@decidim.com describing the nature of your potential contribution and asking for help.
